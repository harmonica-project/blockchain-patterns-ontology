:ContextAndProblem "In collaborative processes where different organizations use shared data, the integrity of this common piece of data is a crucial trust concern. When data can be altered and manipulated, this might lead to anomalies and malicious behavior. For collaborators, it is hard to verify the integrity of the data and trace its provenance. Data integrity is an uncertainty where collaborators have to rely on the organization providing data."^^rdfs:Literal ;
:Solution "In the tamper-proof hashed data storage pattern, the collaborator who acts as the data origin hashes the file. The hash is submitted through a transaction to the blockchain. A message with the hash is sent to data consumers. At any point in time, data consumers can verify the file’s integrity by comparing the hash of the received file with the hash on the blockchain. If the hashes do not match up, data has been changed."^^rdfs:Literal ;

:ContextAndProblem "Non-repudiation of event occurrences is a trust concern in collaborative business processes. During the inter-organizational collaboration, incidents like failures during an activity execution might imply following different workflows. One instance of this is the error event. Therefore, it is essential that organizations cannot deny the occurrence of an event afterward to avoid compensation claims from other stakeholders. In terms of trust-aware business processes, the organization causes a trust concern regarding the non-repudiation of event occurrences."^^rdfs:Literal ;
:Solution "Using the blockchain as a decentralized event log means to save the occurrence of events and data related to them immutably on a shared distributed ledger, as described in [21]. Technically, this can be implemented similar to the blockchain hashed data storage trust pattern. "^^rdfs:Literal ;

:ContextAndProblem "For the successful execution of an instance of a business process, it is inevitable to ensure the correct control flow between subprocesses and activities of different organizations and within the same organization. To ensure the execution of a business process according to its defining model, business process engines [22] are commonly utilized. Traditionally, such engines are centrally managed. This implies that all other collaborators have to trust that the business process engine managed by one collaborator acts as intended. From a trust-aware BPM view, this means that there is uncertainty regarding the correctness (integrity) of the process flow present."^^rdfs:Literal ;
:Solution "Blockchain-based business processes engines, as proposed by Lopez-Pintado et al. [23], store business process models in smart contracts on a blockchain. All collaborators have access to the smart contract and can, at any point, verify the model’s correctness."^^rdfs:Literal ;

In the case the blockchain is used as a distributed database for more general purposes other than financial services, the applications built on blockchain might need to interact with other external systems. Thus, the validation of transactions on blockchain might depend on states of external systems. The execution environment of a blockchain is self-contained. It can only access information present in the data and transactions on the blockchain. Smart contracts running on blockchain are pure functions by design. The state of external systems are not directly accessible to smart contracts. Yet, function calls in smart contracts sometimes need to access state of the external world. How can function calls in smart contracts be enabled to access the state of the external world from within smart contracts?"^^rdfs:Literal ;
:Solution "To connect the closed execution environment of blockchain with the external world, a oracle is introduced to evaluate conditions that cannot be expressed in a smart contract running within the blockchain environment. A oracle is a trusted third party that provides the smart contracts with information about the external world. When validation of a transaction depends on external state, the oracle is requested to check the external state and to provide the result to the validator (miner), which then takes the result provided by the oracle into account when validating the transaction. The oracle can be implemented inside a blockchain network as a smart contract with external state being injected into the oracle periodically by an off-chain injector. Later, other smart contracts can access the data from the oracle smart contract. "^^rdfs:Literal ;

:ContextAndProblem "Some applications consider using the blockchain to guarantee the integrity of large amounts of data. The blockchain, due to its full replication across all participants of the blockchain network, has limited storage capacity. Storing large amounts of data within a transaction may be impossible due to the limited size of the blocks of the blockchain (for example, Ethereum has a block gas limit to determine the number, computational complexity, and data size ofthe transactions included in the block). Data cannot take advantage of the immutability or integrity guarantees without being stored on the blockchain. How to store data of arbitrary size and take advantage of the immutability and integrity guarantees provided by the blockchain?"^^rdfs:Literal ;
:Solution "The blockchain can be used as a general-purpose replicated database, as transactions logged in the blockchain can include arbitrary data on some blockchain platforms. For data of big size (essentially data that is bigger than its hash value), rather than storing the raw data directly on blockchain, a representation of the data with smaller size can be stored on blockchain with other small sized metadata about the data (e.g., a URI pointing to it). The solution is to store a hash value (also called digest) of the raw data on chain. The value is generated by a hash function which maps data of arbitrary size to data of fixed size. Hash function is a one-way function which is easy to compute, but hard to invert given the output of a random input. If even one bit of the data changes, its corresponding hash value would change as well. The hash value is used for ensuring the integrity of the raw data stored off-chain, and the transaction on blockchain that includes the hash value guarantees the integrity of the hash value as well as the original raw data from which the hash was derived."^^rdfs:Literal ;

The question is if it is necessary and cost effective to store all the micro-payment transactions on blockchain. The decentralized design of blockchain has limited performance. Transactions can take several minutes or even one hour (for Bitcoin blockchain) to be committed on the blockchain [17].

The frequency of transaction settlement depends on the use case, and agreement between the two sides. A network of micro-payment channels can be built where the transactions transferring small values occur off-chain.

:ContextAndProblem "Applications based on blockchain might need to use multiple instances of a standard contract with customization. Each contract instance is created by instantiating a contract template. For example, in a business process management system, each of the business process instances might be represented by a smart contract being generated from a contract template representing the business process model [18]. The template can be stored off-chain in a code repository, or on-chain, within its own smart contract. Keeping the contract template off-chain cannot guarantee consistency between different smart contract instances created from the same template because the source code of the template can be independently modified."^^rdfs:Literal ;
:Solution "Smart contracts are created from a contract factory deployed on blockchain. The factory contract is deployed once from the off-chain source code. The factory may contain the definition of multiple smart contracts. Smart contract instances are generated by passing parameters to the contract factory to instantiate customized smart contract instances. Factory contract is analogous to a Class in an object-oriented programming language. Every transaction that generates a smart contract instance essentially instantiates an object of the factory contract class. This contract instance (the object) will maintain its own properties independently of the other instances but with a structure consistent with its original template."^^rdfs:Literal ;

The trustworthiness of a social media profile can be improved by verifying the account using traditional identity issued by some central authority. On the other hand, blockchain provides a decentralised infrastructure for self-sovereign identity, where entities are in control over their own identities. In addition to verification by some certain people or central authorities, a user can link his/her social media profile (e.g. Twitter) to his/her identity registered on blockchain to improve the trustworthiness of both social media profile and blockchain-based identity.

If key loss happens, the original identity owner needs to request for ownership update using a new key pair, and a minimum number of the trustees (e.g. 2 out of 3) must sign a new identity record transaction respectively. When there are enough confirmations (i.e. reaching the threshold) of the new key pair, the ownership of the identifier is updated and thus the identity is recovered.

:Solution "Replay transactions from the source blockchain. When replaying transactions on the target blockchain, their causal relationships must be preserved, e.g., the order of transactions send/received by an account may need to be preserved to maintain consistency of a state. Therefore, first group related transactions in the snapshot file. If abstraction is acceptable, also aggregate the transactions in a group such that the final state is consistent. Third, concurrently replay each independent group of transactions on the target blockchain, while sequentially replaying all transactions within a group to preserve causal relationships. When the private keys or signature format of the source and target blockchains are different, transactions need to be signed again before replaying on the target blockchain. Address of the recipient also needs to be updated when the same addresses cannot be used across the blockchains. Then submit the signed transaction to the target blockchain. The transaction ID (txID) is likely to vary across blockchain instances, and also depends on nonce, sender and receiver addresses, and transaction fees. Hence, use the second last step to update the mapping between old and new txIDs on the ID database on the BAL. Finally, add a PoE entry to reflect new transactions IDs.

:Solution "Translate and deploy a smart contract on the target blockchain. First, verify that the respective source code produces the exact smart contract deployed on the source blockchain. Second, translate the smart contract to the new language. Then, test the functional correctness and security of the translated contract. Fourth, deploy the new smart contract to the target blockchain using the state initialization pattern. Fifth, use the same pattern to set the states of the deployed contract, as per the state recorded on the snapshot. Next, update the mapping between old and new smart contract addresses on the ID database, as smart contract addresses vary across different blockchain instances and could also depend on the address that deployed the smart contract, transaction sequence number, among others. Finally, it is also desirable to include the original and translated code, snapshot file, and mapping between old and new smart contract addresses as a PoE entry, as they are not included in the target blockchain’s history."^^rdfs:Literal ;

:ContextAndProblem "Usually Data lakes are chaotic; they are a store where all the data of a company is accumulated without any kind of structure or rules to use it. For that reason, some people have started to call it Data swamps [12]. This problem can lead to a decrease of the value of the data. The Blockchain security pattern for Big Data Ecosystem tries to improve the traceability and integrity of the data stored in this kind of systems. In a nutshell, this security pattern will help in the implementation of a security solution to tackle a vulnerability of a Big Data ecosystem: huge amount of data can lead to a loss of control of the data and the operations that are performed on them, which can cause a loss of confidence in them."^^rdfs:Literal ;
:Solution "The solution is based on the incorporation of a Blockchain layer that uses the same nodes utilized by the Big Data ecosystems. This layer will act as distributed ledger system that registers all the operations performed over the data stored. In the following subsection, our solution is explained in more detail. The Blockchain security pattern for Big Data ecosystems uses the elements of the SRA as a way to facilitate its implementation in a real scenario. More specifically, this pattern tries to improve the security of the Collector (in the BDAP component) which is implemented by the elements of the BDFP component."^^rdfs:Literal ;

:ContextAndProblem "During past years, the different industries have been impacted by new and disruptive technologies. One of such technologies is smart contracts. One objective of the smart contracts is to translate legal contracts as code or help the legal contract by augmenting some of its clauses into machine-readable functions. The emergence of blockchain technologies has led to the creation of blockchain-based smart contracts, that has benefited from blockchain characteristics. When stored on-chain, data becomes tamper-resistant. Additionally, the utilization of smart contracts isn’t always possible for stakeholders due to concerns about the irreversibility of smart contracts in certain blockchain technologies. For example, creating GDPR compliant blockchains for storing personal data systems is still an open topic. Although not all smart contracts might deal with personal data, there are concerns over the leakage of organizations’ confidential data or their identities, even if data are encrypted. "^^rdfs:Literal ;

The proxy contract can expose some simpler metadata of a patient and later refer to the heavyweight implementation on demand to obtain the real data object. Each read request and modification operation of the data store can be logged in an audit trail that is transparent to the entire blockchain network for verification against data corruption.

Only if valid signatures of both participants are supplied with a requested new state, the new state is applied. This contract is deployed to the blockchain and both participants optionally make a deposit. Then, the participants perform transactions purely off-chain and peer-topeer, without involving the blockchain: One participant computes a new state, wraps it in a transaction, signs it and sends it to his counterpart. The recipient then checks the new state, signs the transaction as well in case he agrees and sends it back to the sender.
